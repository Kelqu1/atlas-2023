	"description": "In the web novel/manhwa/webtoon Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, the co-protagonist Yoo Joonghyuk is often called a Sunfish by the protagonist Kim Dokja. This refers to the game \"Survive! Mola Mola,\" where a sunfish must be kept alive and navigate the dangers of the sea. However, the sunfish easily dies from various causes, requiring players to start over many times. This parallels how Yoo Joonghyuk needed over a thousand rounds to reach a conclusive end to scenarios and how he died easily, especially in the early rounds.",
